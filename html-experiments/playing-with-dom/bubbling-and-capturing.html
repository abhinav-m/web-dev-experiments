    <!-- Example of event bubbling 
The bubbling principle is simple.
When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.
Let’s say, we have 3 nested elements FORM > DIV > P with a handler on each of them:

    <body onclick="alert('body')">
        <form onclick="alert('form')">FORM
            <div onclick="alert('div')">DIV
                <p onclick="alert('p')">P</p>
            </div>
        </form>
        <!-- Almost all events bubble.
The key word in this phrase is “almost”.
For instance, a focus event does not bubble. There are other examples too, we’ll meet them. But still it’s an exception, rather then a rule, most events do bubble.
