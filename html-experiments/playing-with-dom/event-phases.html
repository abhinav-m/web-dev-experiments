    <!-- There’s another phase of event processing called “capturing”. It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful.

        The standard DOM Events describes 3 phases of event propagation:

        Capturing phase – the event goes down to the element.
        Target phase – the event reached the target element.
        Bubbling phase – the event bubbles up from the element.

         the capturing phase is rarely used. Normally it is invisible to us.

         To catch an event on the capturing phase, we need to set the 3rd argument of addEventListener to true.
         There are two possible values for that optional last argument:

         If it’s false (default), then the handler is set on the bubbling phase.
         If it’s true, then the handler is set on the capturing phase.
         Note that while formally there are 3 phases, the 2nd phase (“target phase”: the event reached the element) is not handled separately: handlers on both capturing and bubbling phases trigger at that phase.

         If one puts a handler on the target element – it triggers last on the capturing state, and first on the bubbling stage.
        -->
    <script>
        for (let elem of document.querySelectorAll('*')) {
            elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(`Capturing: ${elem.tagName}`), true); //Add on capturing phase.
            elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));
            /* Please note that P shows up two times: at the end of capturing and at the start of bubbling.
               There’s a property event.eventPhase that tells us the number of the phase on which the event was caught. 
               But it’s rarely used, because we usually know it in the handler. */
        }

<!-- Summary

The event handling process:

When an event happens – the most nested element where it happens gets labeled as the “target element” (event.target).
Then the event first moves from the document root down the event.target, calling handlers assigned with addEventListener(...., true) on the way.
Then the event moves from event.target up to the root, calling handlers assigned using on<event> and addEventListener without the 3rd argument or with the 3rd argument false.

Each handler can access event object properties:

event.target – the deepest element that originated the event.
event.currentTarget (=this) – the current element that handles the event (the one that has the handler on it)
event.eventPhase – the current phase (capturing=1, bubbling=3).

Any event handler can stop the event by calling event.stopPropagation(), but that’s not recommended, 
because we can’t really be sure we won’t need it above, maybe for completely different things.

The same for event handlers. The code that set the handler on a particular element knows maximum details about the element and what it does. 
A handler on a particular <td> may be suited for that exactly <td>, it knows everything about it, so it should get the chance first. 
Then its immediate parent also knows about the context, but a little bit less, and so on till the very top element that handles general concepts and runs the last.

Bubbling and capturing lay the foundation for “event delegation” – an extremely powerful event handling pattern.
